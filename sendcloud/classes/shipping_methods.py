        This endpoint works based on your default sender address which extends to the behaviour written below:

        Please read about the expected behaviour below.
        If you have sender addresses in multiple countries,
        this means you have to set a default carrier service for each country.
        Take Colissimo and PostNL as an example - If your default sender address is set to the country of Netherlands,
        you will not be able to retrieve the Colissimo shipping method by providing its ID.
        This occurs when a sender address in France is not provided in the parameter.
