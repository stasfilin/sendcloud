        You can insert shipments into an API integration.
        This is a more refined and supported way of creating shipments within our
        Panel which then can be used to generate Parcels easily.
        This endpoint has a way more relaxed validation than our
        Parcel API endpoint and is recommended for third party integrators.

        This is an UPSERT endpoint. This means that this endpoint tries to be idempotent given specific fields,
        updating our database values if there’s a match or creating a new entry if there is not.

        Our system will ensure uniqueness of shipments with the
        combination of external_order_id and external_shipment_id.

        The system will only update orders that have had their updated_at (ISO 8601 DateTime) timestamp changed.

        The field external_shipment_id is used to split orders across multiple shipments,
        this feature is not supported in all shop systems.
        However, if the shop has this feature and allows the distribution of the product items of an order across
        different shipments you can use the shipment data instead of plain order,
        and create multiples entries for each shipment. When the order is created and does not have any shipments yet,
        you can send external_shipment_id as null.

        If the shop does not multiple shipments per order, or you wish to only synchronize orders,
        this feature you can sent the external_shipment_id with null value.

        Batches are limited to 100 orders at once.
